# v-and-bruno-tools

I would love to tell you that this project is based on some need, and a lot of research. Truth is, it is only based on research. 
There are times where you just want to make something cool to test your capabilities, this is it. There are surely better tools out there online, but few to none are as fun to use (as that was the main focus of this project). 

It is part of the V and Bruno's toolset, for it's practicality and the AR model. It was originally meant to be an ARIMA forecasting tool- but we ended up settling for 33% of ARIMA (just the AR part). 

Overall, this project is one of my favorite ones so far - mostly because of it's looks - and how interactive it is with the user. 

If you are a person who wants to use these tools seriously, please note - the AR model is not meant to be 100% accurate - rather as a system of prediction; If you know how your follower to sales ratio, you would be able to use this tools to set dynamic targets for followers, understand how much revenue / sales you can possibly get (based on your follower in x period to sales ratio), or simply use this model for different purposes: logistics (i.e: predicting demand). 

However, do strongly note - the model is not designed for that, in our case it's only designed to be a good way to gauge how much followers you could get. You would not get a 100% factual answer, but you would get close.
